# @devintern/code Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-09

The FSL release. The source is available under FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0, interactive use is free with no license or signup, and unattended automation is licensed via Supporter, Team, or Business plans.

### Added

- **Linear, GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps, and Asana trackers**: full lifecycle support (fetch, status transitions, implementation summary comments), bringing supported trackers to seven: Jira, Linear, Trello, Asana, Azure DevOps, GitHub Issues, and local markdown files
- **`--query` for Trello and Markdown trackers**: batch selection now works across all trackers (`--jql` remains as a deprecated alias)
- **Entitlement grace window**: when the license server is unreachable (network error or 5xx), a cached last-known-good entitlement is honored for 72 hours so an outage never blocks paying customers' automation

### Changed

- **License**: switched to the Functional Source License (FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0); each release converts to Apache-2.0 after two years
- **Licensing model (breaking)**: interactive runs no longer perform any license check; unattended execution (systemd, cron, CI, webhook server) requires an automation license (Supporter, Team, or Business). Pre-FSL product SKUs are no longer recognized; existing perpetual license holders receive equivalent entitlements

### Removed

- **14-day trial (breaking)**: interactive use is free forever and needs no trial; unattended automation is covered by the subscription's 30-day money-back guarantee instead

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Trello support**: Implement tasks from Trello cards (short link, full URL, or card ID)
  - Fetch card details and comments, post feasibility and implementation comments
  - Move cards between lists via `settings.json` (`inProgressStatus`, `prStatus`, `todoStatus`)
  - Set `TASK_TRACKER=trello` with `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_API_TOKEN`

- **Multi-tracker project settings**: Tracker-specific sections in `settings.json` (`jira`, `trello`, etc.)

- **Generic CLI flags**: `--query` replaces `--jql`; `--skip-comments` replaces `--skip-jira-comments` (legacy flags still work with deprecation warnings)

### Changed

- **Default `--max-turns`**: Implementation now defaults to **500** turns (was 25). Clarity checks still use 10 turns.

### Removed

- **`--no-agent` flag**: DevIntern always runs the full workflow (clarity check → agent → commit/PR) after fetching task details. Use `--skip-clarity-check` or `--no-git` when you need to limit automation scope.

### Fixed

- **Agent never ran by default**: Fixed a regression where the CLI checked `options.claude` after the flag was renamed to `--no-agent`, causing fetch-only exits with manual instructions.

- **Trello board ID lookup**: Settings keyed by board short link now resolve correctly when cards return the internal 24-character board ID.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Estimation Mode**: New `--estimate` flag runs Claude to estimate story points for JIRA tasks
  - Fibonacci-scale estimates (1–21) with confidence level, reasoning, risks, and unclear areas
  - Auto-discovers and sets the story points field in JIRA
  - Posts rich estimation comment to JIRA; low-confidence estimates ask for more details
  - Skips tasks created less than 24 hours ago
  - Per-project `storyPointsField` override in `settings.json`
  - Example: `devintern --estimate --jql "project = PROJ AND status = 'To Do'"`

- **Smart Re-Estimation**: Re-estimates tasks updated since the last estimate
  - Compares issue `updated` timestamp against estimation comment date
  - Updates existing comment in place instead of creating duplicates

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Plan-Implementation Pipeline**: Detects when Claude creates a plan instead of implementing, then automatically re-runs Claude to implement it

- **Claude Subprocess Timeout**: Configurable timeout (default: 60 min, via `AGENT_HARNESS_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`) prevents queue blocking

### Changed

- **Webhook Review Flow**: Faster webhook responses, review iterations squashed into single commit, removed noisy reply comments

### Fixed

- **Worktree Branch Handling**: Fixed branch switching, stale worktree state, and recovery when Claude switches branches during review

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Automatic PR Self-Review Loop**: New `--auto-review` flag enables iterative self-improvement of PRs
  - Claude reviews its own PR diff and identifies issues by priority (critical/high/medium/low/info)
  - Automatically addresses medium+ priority issues in iterative cycles
  - Configurable max iterations (default: 5) via `--auto-review-max-iterations`
  - Saves review artifacts (feedback.json, prompts) to output directory for debugging
  - Integrated into webhook server via `WEBHOOK_AUTO_REVIEW=true`

- **Auto-Review Trigger Phrases**: Webhook server responds to simple trigger phrases in reviews
  - Supported phrases: "enhance", "improve", "polish", "refine", "clean up", "self-review", etc.
  - Example: Post a review with just `@devintern enhance` to trigger auto-review loop
  - Skips normal review flow and runs self-review directly

- **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**: All HTTP API calls now have robust retry logic
  - Automatic retries on 5xx errors and network failures
  - Exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s) with random jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Configurable max retries (default: 3)

- **Detailed Issue Logging**: Auto-review loop now logs each issue with priority and location
  - Format: `[priority] (file:line): issue description`
  - Makes it easy to see what issues will be addressed in each iteration

### Changed

- **Webhook Auto-Review Flow**: Restructured to validate hooks and batch changes before pushing
  - Runs pre-push hook validation locally before any push
  - Auto-review runs with `skipPush: true` to accumulate all improvements
  - Re-validates hooks after auto-review changes
  - Single push at the end with all review fixes and auto-review improvements

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-24

### Breaking Changes

- **Bun Runtime Required**: The tool now requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime instead of Node.js
  - Install via `bun install -g @devintern/code` (not npm)
  - Run directly via `bunx @devintern/code` or after global install

### Added

- **Webhook Server for Automated PR Reviews**: New `serve-webhook` command that automatically addresses PR review feedback
  - Listens for GitHub webhook events and processes `changes_requested` reviews when bot is mentioned
  - SQLite-based persistent queue (`bun:sqlite`) for crash-resilient processing with automatic recovery on restart
  - Dedicated worktree at `/tmp/devintern-review-worktree/` provides isolation from main repository
  - Automatically detects and installs project dependencies (supports bun, pnpm, npm, yarn, poetry, uv, pip)
  - Commits attributed to GitHub App bot account (`app-name[bot]`) for clear audit trail
  - Fetches complete review context including all comments and conversation threads
  - Posts implementation summaries as PR review replies
  - Configurable via `WEBHOOK_PORT`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and other environment variables

- **Address-Review Command**: Manual PR review processing via `devintern address-review <pr-url>`
  - Handles single PR review on-demand without running webhook server
  - Uses same worktree isolation and dependency installation as webhook server

### Changed

- **Review Worktree Location**: Moved from `.devintern-code/review-worktree/` to `/tmp/devintern-review-worktree/`
  - Better isolation from main repository
  - Automatic cleanup of stale worktree registrations from old paths

- **Optimized Worktree Operations**: Improved performance for worktree preparation
  - Shallow clone with `--depth 1` for faster initial setup
  - Simplified preparation logic with reduced error noise
  - Single reusable worktree instead of per-PR worktrees

### Fixed

- **Fetch All PR Review Comments**: Now fetches all comments from the PR, not just the latest review
  - Ensures Claude sees complete review context
  - Handles pagination for PRs with many comments

- **Stale Worktree Registration Handling**: Gracefully handles orphaned worktree entries
  - Automatically unregisters worktrees pointing to non-existent directories
  - Prevents "fatal: is already checked out" errors

### Technical

- **Dependencies**: Added `bun:sqlite` for persistent queue (bundled with Bun runtime)
- **Build Process**: Updated `build.ts` to target Bun runtime
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md, USAGE.md, and CLAUDE.md to reflect Bun requirement

## [1.3.1] - 2025-12-23

### Added

- **Automatic Target Branch Detection**: Extract target branch from JIRA task descriptions
  - Add "Target branch: develop" (or "Base branch:" or "PR target:") to task description
  - Supports markdown formatting: `**Target branch**: develop`, `## Target branch: develop`, etc.
  - Falls back to `--pr-target-branch` CLI option when not specified
  - Perfect for server automation where different tasks target different branches

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **GitHub App Authentication**: Organizations can now use GitHub Apps for PR creation instead of individual personal access tokens
  - Each organization creates their own GitHub App for centralized control
  - Fine-grained permissions: only requires Contents (Read) and Pull requests (Read and write)
  - No individual tokens needed - the App authenticates itself
  - Centralized audit trail - all actions show as coming from the App
  - Supports two private key formats:
    - File path: `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/key.pem`
    - Base64-encoded: `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64=...` (useful for CI/CD)
  - JWT-based authentication with automatic installation token caching
  - Falls back gracefully if App is not installed on a repository
  - **Auto-detected Git author**: Commits are automatically attributed to the GitHub App's bot account (e.g., `my-app[bot]`)

### Changed

- Updated documentation across all markdown files with GitHub App setup instructions
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` takes precedence over GitHub App credentials when both are configured

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- **Comment Filtering**: Automatically filter out @devintern/code's own automated comments when fetching task context
  - Prevents context pollution by excluding previous assessment/implementation comments
  - Ensures Claude only sees genuine user and stakeholder feedback
  - Handles all JIRA comment formats: string, rendered HTML, and Atlassian Document Format (ADF)
  - Uses three unique markers to identify automated comments:
    - "Implementation Completed by @devintern/code"
    - "Automated Task Feasibility Assessment"
    - "Implementation Incomplete"
  - Logs number of filtered comments for transparency
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 22 new tests

- **Automatic Git Pull**: Pull latest changes from remote before starting task processing
  - Ensures local repository is up-to-date before creating feature branches
  - Prevents merge conflicts from stale local branches
  - Fetches and pulls from remote origin automatically

- **Automatic JIRA Status Transitions**: Enhanced workflow automation with status transitions
  - **Start Transition**: Automatically move task to "In Progress" when starting implementation (if configured via `inProgressStatus`)
  - **Success Transition**: Automatically move task to review status after PR creation (if configured via `prStatus`)
  - **Failure Transition**: Automatically move task back to "To Do" if implementation fails (if configured via `todoStatus`)
  - Per-project configuration via `settings.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "projects": {
        "PROJ": {
          "inProgressStatus": "In Progress",
          "todoStatus": "To Do",
          "prStatus": "In Review"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - Smart status transition detection based on available JIRA workflows

- **Incomplete Implementation Handling**: Better handling when Claude cannot complete a task
  - Posts detailed incomplete implementation comments to JIRA
  - Includes possible reasons for incompletion (clarity, scope, blockers)
  - Provides actionable recommendations for task improvements
  - Duplicate prevention: Skips posting if same task description already has incomplete comment
  - Transitions task back to "To Do" status (if configured)
  - Saves task description for duplicate detection on retry

- **Auto-Commit Recovery**: Automatically commit/amend changes when Claude forgets
  - Detects when Claude makes changes but doesn't commit them
  - Prompts user to auto-commit or amend previous commit
  - Helps recover from interrupted workflows
  - Includes clear git amend instructions in push hook prompts

### Fixed

- **Lock File Cleanup**: Release PID lock file on all exit paths
  - Fixed issue where lock file wasn't cleaned up on early exits (e.g., missing env vars)
  - Lock file now properly released during error conditions, SIGINT, SIGTERM, and uncaught exceptions
  - Prevents stale locks from blocking subsequent runs

- **Status Transition Timing**: Move "In Progress" transition to after clarity assessment
  - Prevents marking tasks as "In Progress" when they fail the clarity check
  - Only transitions to "In Progress" after confirming task is implementable
  - More accurate workflow state management

### Technical

- **Test Coverage Expansion**: Added 22 comprehensive comment filtering tests
  - Tests for all three comment formats (string, HTML, ADF)
  - Edge case handling (null, undefined, empty, malformed bodies)
  - Marker uniqueness verification
  - All 99 tests passing across 5 test suites
